You do not have to take your Liberal courses in your first year of study; liberal courses just have to be completed before you apply to graduate. Many students use the Spring/Summer term to complete their liberals or complete them in their later years so they can concentrate more on their Engineering courses, especially in their first year. In total, students must take TWO (2) Table A - Lower Level Liberals, ONE (1) Table B - Upper Level Liberal, and ONE (1) Engineering Upper Level Liberal. \n\nPlease note that first-year engineering midterms are often held on Fridays from 6 p.m. - 8 p.m., so you should ensure that you do not enroll in a Liberal studies course that conflicts with this time.\n"

   "Question": "What happens if I’m Required to Withdraw?                    \n\nWhat is Reinstatement/ Fresh Start? \n\n",
   "Answer": {
      "Resource": "This means that students will be required to withdraw from their program and Ryerson for 12 months. Students will be expected to attend a MANDATORY Required to Withdraw seminar where specific information will be presented to students regarding their next steps as an RTW student. Some of which include ways that students may improve their chances of being reinstated back into your program.                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nIf a student is Required to Withdraw, and their CGPA is at least 1.33 or higher, the student may be eligible for the Fresh Start Program after sitting out one semester. Pending approval, the student may pursue reinstatement or transfer to another program by taking two courses for credit in their first semester back and four courses in their second semester back.\n\n"

   "Question": "What if I didn’t pass the Writing Skills Test (WST)?",
   "Answer": {
      "Resource": "If you don't pass the WST, you will receive a grade of INP (in-progress) in CEN 199, and are  encouraged to enroll in LNG 111, LNG 112, LNG 113, or LNG 121, depending on the outcome of the WST assessment. These are writing-intensive humanities and social science courses designed to give you the opportunity to strengthen your foundation in communication. They also count as lower-level liberal studies courses.\n\nIf you don't pass your second attempt at the WST, or you just want to further develop your language and writing skills after completing the LNG courses, you may benefit from Ryerson's online and/or in-class preparatory English language courses offered through the G. Raymond Chang School of Continuing Education, opens in new window.\n\nNote: You may not proceed into the third year of your engineering program without passing the WST. But if you don't pass the test during orientation, you will have more chances to write and pass the test.\n\nA reminder that students are not encouraged to take the first Table A listed in the calendar in the first Fall or Winter semester.\n"

   "Question": "Can I take a Liberal before doing the WST?",
   "Answer": {
      "Resource": "Yes, you can take a Liberal before completing the WST successfully. Keep in mind that Liberal courses will be writing heavy so if you didn't do well in the WST you may find the Liberal course challenging. We also encourage students to take a reduced course load in their first year, a Liberal course is one you may want to consider taking over the Spring Summer semesters. \nNeed to complete WST before moving into the 3rd year of study.  For more information and recent updates about the WST, please view the FYEO Website here."
